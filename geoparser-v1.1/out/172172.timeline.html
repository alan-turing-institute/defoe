  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2020-01-17</h2><p><span class="per">Nadal</span> and <span class="per">Murray</span> set up semi showdown
(<span class="org">CNN</span>) -- <span class="per">Rafael Nadal</span> and <span class="per">Andy Murray</span> are both through to the semifinals of the Rogers Cup in <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, where they will face each other for a place in <span class="date">Sunday</span>'s final.
<span class="per">Murray</span> played some superb tennis in crushing the in-form <span class="per">David Nalbandian</span> but <span class="per">Nadal</span> had to recover from dropping the opening set to get past <span class="loc">Germany</span>'s <span class="per">Philipp Kohlschreiber</span>.
<span class="per">Nalbandian</span> won the ATP title in <span class="loc">Washington</span> <span class="date">last weekend</span> and came into <span class="date">Friday</span>'s encounter on an 11-match unbeaten streak.
But the fourth-seeded Briton, who has struggled to find his top form <span class="date">this season</span>, brushed aside the Argentine in impressive fashion, securing a 6-2 6-2 victory in just 69 minutes.
"It was probably one of the best matches I've played <span class="date">this year</span>," <span class="per">Murray</span> told the official ATP Tour website.
"I served well and got the first good hits in a lot of the rallies, so I was able to dictate a lot of the points," added <span class="per">Murray</span> -- who is the defending champion after winning the tournament in <span class="loc">Montreal</span> <span class="date">last year</span>.
Meanwhile, top seed <span class="per">Nadal</span> also secured his place in the last four, but he was not as impressive as <span class="per">Murray</span> in a 3-6 6-3 6-4 victory over <span class="per">Kohlschreiber</span>
In the evening session, third seed <span class="per">Federer</span> will face a <span class="loc">Wimbledon</span> re-match with Czech <span class="per">Tomas Berdych</span>, who beat him in the quarterfinals of the grasscourt tournament.
The winner of that match will face either second seed <span class="per">Novak Djokovic</span> or <span class="per">Jeremy Chardy</span> of <span class="loc">France</span> for a place in the final.</p><br><br>
